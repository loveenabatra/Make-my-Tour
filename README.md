# Make-my-Tour

##INTRODUCTION

The computers have gained a lot of importance in the past five decades. Most of our day-to-day jobs are being influenced by the use of computers. Now a day, computers are used for performing almost every function, which were performed by humans in the past. In some areas such as science and technology, targets canâ€™t be achieved without the use of
computers. The characteristics the make the computer so important includes its extra ordinary speed, large storage capacity, accuracy and consistency.
Today computers play a great role in various industries and a large numbers of industries are using computer for various applications such as maintaining cashbook, sales book, purchase book, and other books of accounts. Computer can also be used for the designing of the various products. Computers provide many options for the designing of products.

This programme helps the users to book their flight tickets to various destinations. The project pertains only in the flightiness operation of booking a passenger and reserving a seat in a flight and provides a payment process that will generate ticket in the ticketing system.



##OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT

The objective/purpose of this project is to allow the users to book their flight tickets, it automatically reflects the available flights and this programme also allows the user to visualise the fare amount through bar graph of each airline and hence the user can compare the fare of each airline and then the user can book the flight at their convenience and make the payment through the credit card, debit card or UPI.



##APPLICATIONS USED IN THIS PROJECT

PYTHON PANDAS:
Python is an object-oriented programming language that can be used for analysing data, developing web applications, games, etc. Python is currently the most widely used multipurpose, high level programming language. Python has the huge collection of standard libraries which can be used in many ways. Python is simple and easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance python language is being used by almost all tech giant companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook Instagram etc.

CSV:
A CSV (comma-separated values) file is a text file that has a specific format which allows data to be saved in a table structured format. It is a way to exchange structured information, like the contents of a spreadsheet. It is the spreadsheet but with a .csv extension. CSV files help in exporting a high volume of data to more concentrated database. CSV files are plain text files, making them easier for the website developer to create.

Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. It was introduced by John Hunter in the year 2002. One of the greatest benefits of visualization is that it allows us visual access to huge amounts of data in easily digestible visuals. Matplotlib consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc. It is used along with NumPy to provide an environment that is an effective open-source alternative for MATLAB. It can also be used with graphics tool kits like PyQt and wxPython.
